It is with great enthusiasm that I inaugurate this space. My name is José Pedro, a passionate software engineer and tireless researcher, always in search of new horizons in the field of technology. In this blog, I will share my discoveries, projects, and, of course, a bit of code.

**My Journey**

I started to become interested in technology in high school, thanks to the school labs I attended that used Linux, and soon I was dabbling in programming. I decided to pursue a degree in the field of technology, and soon I was researching the development of educational technologies. I then proceeded to a master's degree and after some time teaching and working in the industry, I recently started a PhD in Informatics in Education, an area where I serve as a Tech Lead at an EdTech.

**What to expect from this blog?**

This site will serve as a platform not only to share my work and projects but also insights, tutorials, and discussions on the latest trends and challenges in technology. Here, you will find:

- **Posts:** Reflections on my journey, lessons learned, and the challenges I faced.
- **Tutorials and Guides:** From quick tips to in-depth guides on programming, frameworks, tools, and much more.
- **Research:** I will share insights about my research on educational technology.

**An Invitation**

I consider this first post not just an introduction, but an invitation. An invitation for you to join me on this journey of discovery, learning, and creation. There's a universe of possibilities out there, and I can't wait to explore it with you.

So, if you're ready to embark on this adventure with me, feel free to explore, read, learn, and interact. Let's together unravel the mysteries of technology and create something truly incredible.

See you later,

Zé
