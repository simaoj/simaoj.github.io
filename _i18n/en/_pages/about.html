                Hi! My name is Jos√© Pedro, I'm based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and my passion is to develop stuff for the Internet. I started to get interested in the Web and Linux in 2008, still in high school, when I learned HTML and CSS to customize blog templates.

                So I decided to graduate in IT, but before pursuing a career on software engineering, I worked as a researcher in the area of information technology in education and as a lecturer. During this period I had the opportunity to study and work in Canada twice - during my bachelor's through the Science without Borders program from the Brazilian Government and during my master's through the Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program from the Canadian Government.

                After that, I worked as IT analyst and as software engineer in one of the most important IT companies in the world. Today I'm a Tech Lead in an educational technology company and I'm doing a PhD in Informatics in Education.
